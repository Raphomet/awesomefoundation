The Awesome Foundation

Very brief notes on getting the app running:

Prerequisites:
* git
* ruby
* rails (v 2.3.x)
* mysql
* gem (to install ruby mysql bindings)

Do:
choose a location and download the source
 $ git clone https://github.com/awesomefoundation/awesomefoundation.git
it'll make a dir called 'awesomefoundation'. cd into it
Now set up mysql.  create the awesomefound user and grant it access to the dbs that don't exist yet
 $ mysql -u root
 mysql> grant all on awesomefound.* to awesomefound@'%';
Now let rake set up the dbs and tables:
 $ rake db:setup
If you get an error here you may have to install the mysql bindings for ruby/rails which are no longer bundled, or something.  The error message will say this.  Just do:
 $ sudo gem install mysql
Finally you can run the webrick server (or is it mongrel these days?)
 $ ./script/server
Note that there is not any data in the db as yet.
